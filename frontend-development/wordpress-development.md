# Wordpress Front-End Development 

## Design & User Interface 
- [ ]  Theme Consistency: Ensure your work aligns with the overall theme and 
design language of the site. Verify color schemes, typography, button 
styles, and other design elements for consistency. 
 
- [ ] Page Layouts: Validate all pages for their structure and layout. They 
should follow the design templates and wireframes provided. 
 
- [ ] Responsiveness: Check responsiveness across different devices and 
screen sizes: 
 
  - Desktop: 1920x1080 
  - Laptop: 1366x768 
  - Tablet: 768x1024 
  - Mobile: 360x640 

- [ ] Browser Compatibility: Ensure the site appears and functions as 
expected on all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. 
 
- [ ] Interactive Elements: Ensure all interactive elements such as buttons, 
sliders, dropdown menus, forms, tabs, modals, and accordions etc. are 
working properly and have appropriate feedback states (hover, active, 
disabled). 
 
- [ ] Dummy content: Ensure all dummy content is removed before handing 
the project over to the client. This part comes in the final review. For 
example: Lorem Ipsum text, dummy images, links to theme builder website 
etc. 
 
## Functionality 
- [ ] Links & Navigation: Verify all internal and external links, menu items, and 
button redirects. The navigation should be intuitive and error-free. 
 
- [ ] Plugins: Check that all utilized plugins are up-to-date, compatible with 
your version of Wordpress, and do not conflict with each other or with the 
site's functionality. All plugins and themes should be scanned with 
VirusTotal or a similar service to ensure they are free of malware. 
 
- [ ] Forms & Data Submission: Validate the correct operation of all forms, 
including data submission, validation, and confirmation messages or 
emails. 
 
## Performance & Optimization 
- [ ] Page Load Speed: Measure page load speed with tools such as Google 
PageSpeed Insights, GTMetrix, or Pingdom. Take appropriate actions to 
optimize load times. 
 
- [ ] Image & Media Optimization: Confirm that all images, videos, and other 
media files are optimized for web use without compromising quality. 
Images should be saved in the appropriate format (JPEG for photos and 
complex images, PNG for simple or transparent images, and SVG for icons 
and logos) and should be compressed for web use. The exact resolution will 
depend on your layout, but try to keep images under 500KB and the 
dimensions not exceeding their display size on the site. 
 
- [ ] Lazy Loading: If your page includes a lot of images or media, ensure lazy 
loading is implemented correctly. 
 
## SEO & Accessibility 
- [ ] SEO Compliance: Make sure SEO best practices are applied to each 
page, including appropriate keyword usage, metadata, alt text for images, 
and implementation of schema if applicable. 
 
- [ ] Accessibility Standards: The website should comply with WCAG 2.1 
accessibility standards. This includes proper use of alt text, sufficient color 
contrast, keyboard navigation support, and screen reader compatibility. 
 
## Security 
- [ ] Secure Connections: Ensure that your website uses HTTPS connections 
for secure data transmission. 
 
- [ ] Data Validation & Sanitization: Ensure that any input from users is 
validated and sanitized to protect against potential security threats such 
as XSS attacks and SQL injections. 
 
- [ ] Error Reporting: Turn off error reporting for your live website to prevent 
potential information leaks that could be exploited by attackers. 
 
- [ ] Testing & Documentation 
User Testing: Perform user testing to identify potential UX issues, hidden 
bugs, or unintuitive design elements. 
 
- [ ] Automated Testing: Utilize automated testing tools for functionality, 
performance, SEO, and accessibility checks. Tools could include Selenium, 
Google Lighthouse, aXe, Screaming Frog SEO Spider, etc. 
## Documentation
